# PlantDataBase
This Java-based CRUD app manages Plant records using the DAO pattern for database interaction. DBConnect handles the connection, while DAO and PlantImpl manage CRUD operations. Main serves as the entry point for execution, ensuring a clean separation of concerns between business logic and database access.
